## 💡 Inspiration

Inspired by platforms like **Twitch**, **Netflix Party**, and **YouTube Live**, **Stream** aims to make content viewing a **shared experience** — no matter the distance.

And yes — for the 90s kids: get ready for **coin sounds, pixel fonts**, and maybe a few "**It's-a me!**" surprises along the way. 🍄
